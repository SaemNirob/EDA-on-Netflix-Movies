# Netflix Movies Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Netflix Movies dataset**, aiming to uncover valuable insights into various aspects of movies available on Netflix, including ratings, genres, release years, and more.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Addressed missing values, formatted data, and performed necessary transformations.
- **Visualizations**: Created a variety of visualizations to explore relationships and patterns in the data (such as the distribution of movie ratings, genres, and release years).
- **Key Findings**: Analyzed trends in movie popularity, genre distribution, and release patterns over the years.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Distribution of Movie Genres**: Insights into which genres dominate the Netflix platform.
- **Release Trends**: Exploration of release years and how movie production has evolved.
- **Rating Insights**: Analysis of movie ratings and their relation to release years, genres, and more.

## 🧑‍💻 Tools & Libraries

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Identified the most popular movie genres on Netflix.
- Visualized trends in movie production and releases.
- Analyzed how ratings vary across different genres and years.

This project demonstrates how EDA techniques can help uncover hidden patterns in a dataset and drive decision-making based on data-driven insights.
